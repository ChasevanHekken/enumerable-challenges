Your boss wants into your office with Stew Foreman-Fowler. "Hi, this is Stew Foreman-Fowler," she says.

You quietly respond, "Don't we already have someone named Stew Foreman-Fowler?"

"Exactly," she replies. "We're going to need some employee IDs before this gets out of control. Could you take an array of employees and give me a hash with employee IDs as keys and their name as the values? You can just start at 0 and work your way up I guess."
