Waldemar from sales has heard about the work you've done with processing large amounts of data. You're something of a legend around the office.

He corners you in the break room as you try to buy a Baby Ruth.

"Hey, do you think you could do me a solid? We have this big database of clients and we'd like to know everyone who hasn't placed an order from us in the last month so we can call them up and give them our hardest pitch. Could you write one of those fancy scripts for us to return an array of all of our lapsed clients from an array?"

You reluctantly agree.
