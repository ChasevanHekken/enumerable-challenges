You head down to the staff lounge to grab a much-need cup of coffee. Sylvestor ambushes you from seemingly out of nowhere.

"GREAT NEWS," he shouts in your ear, "the board approved my team building program!" Apparently you and Sly have different definitions for "great news."

"Could you take that staff roster and split everyone into random groups of 3? No maybe 4. Actually, 5. No, definitely 3. You should probably make it so I can change my mind. I so that a lot," he rambles on.

You turn around, coffee-less, and head back to your desk.

He's still talking.
