"I'm trying to organize an interdepartmental cricket tournament. But our mainframe will only spit out a single list of the company employees. That's no good. I need them by department. I don't know a lot about this Haskell programming language you've been using to solve everyone's issues, but I was thinking maybe you could give me back a hash with each department as a key and then an array of staff members in an array as the value for each key. Yea, but like I said, I don't know much about Python."
