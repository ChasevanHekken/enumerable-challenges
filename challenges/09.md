Returning from lunch, you hear some quibbling down the hall. Rhoda and Bruno are trying to access the shipping department's one terminal at the same time. Rhoda wants to look up what the next heaviest box is. Bruno is trying to find out what the lightest box is. They look up and see you coming down the hall.

"Oh hey! We were wondering if you could write us a script that would give us back both the heaviest and the lightest shipment at the same time. Do you think you could do that for us?"
